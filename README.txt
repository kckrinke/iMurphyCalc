iMurphyCalc
===========

This is a simple iOS 4.2 (or greater) application written in a weekend with a few extra hours cleaning it up and making it at least partially palatable for the general public in terms of source code.

The application itself is intended for use on an iPhone or iPod and does not require any internet access in order to function properly.

Upon starting up the app on your iDevice, you are presented with a simple screen with a percentage indicator, a (not-quite-pretty-but-makes-the-point) cartoon thermometer and five slider widgets. Each slider widget corresponds to the different user-input attributes of the Sod’s Law formula as defined by a 2004 British Gas study and reported in the October 7th 2004 issue of the UK publication “The Mirror”. That report sparked a bunch of semi-fan sites that implemented CGI versions of the formula and I’ve decided that I wanted this sort of functionality but built-for-my-phone. So, I’ve made it and decided to give it away. As I don’t own any rights to the actual formula itself there really isn’t anything else that’s truly novel or special about this application making it worth monetizing on the app store (though it has been submitted as a free download application).

Enjoy!
